>useRef hook intrigued me a lot until I found this project, which explains clearly what it means. The text-book definition for useRef goes like this:

To get access to the DOM, you need to ask React to give you access to a particular DOM node when it renders your component. The way this happens is
through a special prop called `ref`.

>useEffect: If you don't need to interact with the DOM at all or your DOM changes are unobservable (seriously, most of the time you should use this).
